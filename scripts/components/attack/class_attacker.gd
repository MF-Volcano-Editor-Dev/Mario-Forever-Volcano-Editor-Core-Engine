## Used as a child of [Area2D] to provide collision reaction like an projectile. Usually works with [Attackee].
##
## This is used as a child node of [Area2D] so that it may automatically connect the collision detection to process of attacking [Attackee].
## Usually works with [Attackee] and see it for more details.

signal attacked_target(target: Attackee) ## Emitted when the area collides with another one containing [Attackee] and the interaction with the [Attackee] is successful.
signal attack_succeeded ## Emitted when the enemy attacked gets damaged successfully. [br][b]Called by [EnemyKillingProcess2D].[/b]
signal attack_failed ## Emitted when the enemy attacked defended the attacker. [br][b]Called by [EnemyKillingProcess2D].[/b]

## Id of the attacker. See [enum DataList.AttackId], [member Attackee.filter_ids] and [enum Attackee.FilterMode] for details.
@export var id: DataList.AttackId = DataList.AttackId.NONE
## Damage level of the attacker.[br]
## This may cause [Attackee] with lower [member Attackee.defense_level] value fail blocking the attack.
